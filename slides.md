# Role of visualization in the scientific process

Visualization is critical at every stage of the data-centric scientific process

* Data exploration
* Data cleaning and quality control
* Analysis and interpretation
* Communication of results to the scientific community

---

## Benefits of interactive visualizations

* Exploration of large, complex datasets
* Rapid identification of outliers and artifacts
* Interactive hypothesis testing

---

## Current limitations in sharing interactive visualizations

---

## Advantages of browser-based approaches

* Platform independence
* Accessibility via the internet
* No software installation or upgrades
* Integration and collaboration opportunities

---

## Web-Based Approaches

* Hosted platforms (e.g., Jupyter, Google Colab)
* Purpose-built websites for specific datasets

---

## Interactive notebooks: advantages and limitations

---

## Clickable hyperlinks approach

* Example: Neuroglancer
* Dissemination using simple URLs
* Utilization of low-barrier, accessible infrastructure
* Client-side computation for minimal resource usage

---

## Figurl's Goals

* Facilitating easy configuration of cloud resources
* Browser-based computation for visualization
* User-friendly, minimal parameter specification
* Framework for generating shareable URL links from Python scripts
